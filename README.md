Do you live in an apartment that doesn't allow animals? Or miss the time when Tomagochis were in? Look no further! You can have your very own digital pet with the Pocket Pet app. It key features include a cute little animal that you can access from your computer and/or mobile device. You start with an egg, feed it and see what it hatches into. You can also see when other people feed their pets on the app!
