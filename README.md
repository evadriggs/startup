# startup

Do you live in an apartment that doesn't allow animals? Or miss the time when Tamagotchis were cool? Look no further! You can have your very own digital pet with my app. Its key features include a cute little animal that you can access from your computer and/or mobile device. You start with an egg, feed it and see what it hatches into. Click the feed me button until the hunger bar is full for your pet to advance to its next life form. You'll also be notified when other people feed their pets on the app! 

Use this link to see my sketch for the app.

What I've learned from the Simon html
I need to reveiw git commit and push. I'm having trouble figuring out how to make comments within VSC. 
I learned how to make page links accesible on the same page.
I also learned that making the simple images of the simon interface on html was hard. 
I also learned that korean characters will work too.


What I've learned from the Simon CSS
I really like CSS it makes sense in my mind
I'll need to make sure to incorporate the link method in my startup
I'll need to go back and update my start up html if I add something while working through CSS
I should look at what color scheme I want everything to be!


What I've learned from the startup HTML and CSS
Bootstrap is nice, there are lots of resources online showing you how to use other features too
Apparently the world decided to use index.html as the key to deploy things (I'd named mine home.html and had problems deploying)
Um white text doesn't show up on a white background lol
To treat something differently, use a <div class = ""> to name it something and use CSS to grab it a do something else than everything around it
 
 
 What I've learned from the Simon JS:
make sure to include the script source at the bottom if the html changes it!
you should make different JS files for differnt html files
you can add sound with JS!
I think I'll implement sound when I have my caterpillar eat in my startup
