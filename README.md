Do you live in an apartment that doesn't allow animals? Or miss the time when Tamagotchis were cool? Look no further! You can have your very own digital pet with my app. Its key features include a cute little animal that you can access from your computer and/or mobile device. You start with an egg, feed it and see what it hatches into. Click the feed me button until the hunger bar is full for your pet to advance to its next life form. You'll also be notified when other people feed their pets on the app! 

Copy and paste this link to see my sketch for the app.
