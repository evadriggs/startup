Do you live in an apartment that doesn't allow animals? Or miss the time when Tamagotchis were cool? Look no further! You can have your very own digital pet with my app. Its key features include a cute little animal that you can access from your computer and/or mobile device. You start with an egg, feed it and see what it hatches into. Click the feed me button until the hunger bar is full for your pet to advance to its next life form. You'll also be notified when other people feed their pets on the app! 

Use this link to see my sketch for the app.

What I've learned from the Simon html
I need to reveiw git commit and push. I'm having trouble figuring out how to make comments within VSC. 
I learned how to make page links accesible on the same page.
I also learned that making the simple images of the simon interface on html was hard. 
I also learned that korean characters will work too.
