            Do you live in an apartment that doesn't allow animals? 
            Or miss the time when Tamagotchis were cool? Look no further! 
            You can have your very own digital pet with my app. Its key 
            features include a cute little animal that you can access 
            from your computer and/or mobile device. You start with an egg, 
            feed it and see what it hatches into. Click the feed me button 
            until the hunger bar is full for your pet to advance to its next 
            life form. You'll also be notified when other people feed their 
            pets on the app! 
        </p>

            How to Play:
        </p>
        <p>
            Click on the feed button when the pet is hungry and watch it grow!
